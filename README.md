## What is Privatus?  

**Privatus** is an automation tool designed to keep your digital life private without any extra effort. Every time you browse the internet, websites leave behind **cookies, local storage files, caches, and databases**. While some of these help with faster loading, many are used by advertisers and third-party services to build behavioral profiles.  

Privatus solves this by automatically cleaning up after your browsing sessions. It clears out tracking cookies, deletes cache files, and removes hidden databases, leaving you with a faster, cleaner, and safer browsing experience. The process is entirely automatic – once configured, it works in the background with no need for manual cleanup.  

Unlike many generic system cleaners, Privatus is focused purely on **web privacy**. It integrates directly with popular browsers such as **Safari, Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Firefox**, ensuring coverage across multiple environments. It also supports **custom site rules**, letting you stay logged into essential services while removing everything else.  

Key reasons users choose Privatus:  
- **Hands-free protection** – everything is cleared automatically.  
- **Consistency across browsers** – no need to manage privacy separately.  
- **Lightweight operation** – doesn’t slow down your system.  
- **Trusted results** – removes only data that affects privacy, not essential files.  

In a world where online tracking grows more aggressive every day, Privatus provides a **set-it-and-forget-it privacy shield**. Whether you’re working, shopping, or banking online, it ensures that your data footprint stays minimal.
